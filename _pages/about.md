I am a final-year Master's student in Applied Mathematics at the School of Applied Mathematics, Getulio Vargas Foundation (**FGV EMAp**), in Rio de Janeiro, where I also obtained my B.Sc. degree. Currently, I am working under the supervision of <a href='https://www.diegomesquita.com'>Diego Mesquita</a>.

Previously, I worked as a Quantitative Researcher at **Kadima Asset Management**, following my service as a Midshipman in the **Brazilian Navy**.

My research lies broadly in **Probabilistic Machine Learning**. Most recently, I have been focusing on **Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)**, investigating methods to help them explore sparse combinatorial spaces more effectively while mitigating mode collapse.

Recently, I have expanded my research to **Uncertainty Quantification** and rigorous statistical inference with black-box models, working with **Conformal Prediction** and **Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI)**. Additionally, I am currently working on methodological developments in **Computer Vision** in collaboration with researchers at the <a href="https://www.visgraf.impa.br/" target="_blank">Vision and Computer Graphics Laboratory (Visgraf)</a> of IMPA.
